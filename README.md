# ParkingFeesCalculator2.0

The main objective of the project is to
make an android application which will
start a timer on scanning a Qr code and
stop the timer on scanning the Qr code
again and generate a bill showing the
amount that is to be paid. Which will
reduce the complications involved in huge
parking complexes.

SCOPE

The future scope of this project is that we
can in future make a better user interface
which will provide the user the full details
of the availability of space in the parking
plots nearby and even show the available
parking plots in the map near them which
will help in reducing traffic and problems
like parking on a road, and also an online
portal can be added for online payment
